This is a basic angular project that I created to learn the basics of BDD(Behaviour Driven Development) using cucumber and cypress.

# Software(s) required:
* Latest stable version of Node Package Manager
* Latest stable version of Angular CLI

# Project Setup:

Switch to the projects root directory and run `npm install` to install the rquired packages.

* Step 2:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

* Step 3 (running test):

`NB!` Please ensure the server is running, before attempting to run tests.

Run ``` npm run cypress:open``` to run the cypress tests.
